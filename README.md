# SHA-1

A project that hashes data using SHA-1 algorithm in c++

## Note: This method is outdated

NIST has set the date of Dec. 31, 2030 to remove SHA-1 support from all software and hardware devices. The once-widely used algorithm is now easy to crack, making it unsafe to use in security contexts.
