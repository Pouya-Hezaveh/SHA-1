C++ scratch file that hashes data using SHA-1 algorithm

## Note

### <span style="color:#DC3545;">This method is outdated for security purposes.</span>

NIST has set the date of Dec. 31, 2030 to remove SHA-1 support from all software and hardware devices. The once-widely used algorithm is now easy to crack, making it unsafe to use in security contexts.
